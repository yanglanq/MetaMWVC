The code of MetaMWVC Algorithm.


The Minimum Weight Vertex Cover (MWVC) problem has a number of real-world applications and has already been proven to be an NP-hard problem. This paper proposes a general local search framework called MetaMWVC, which is highly configurable and combines many efficient local search strategies, to solve MWVC problems. Because of MetaMWVC's high configurability, we utilized an automatic configuration process to provide best configuration with optimal performance for particular types of MWVC situations. To enhance the efficiency and performance of the automatic configuration process, an instance-based data mining strategy is presented to provide the same configuration for instances with similar features. Experiments on standard benchmarks covering diverse types of MWVC instances, as well as application benchmarks consisting of massive graphs, show that MetaMWVC obtains the best performance for almost all instances, and obtains better solutions than state-of-the-art algorithms on large scale graphs.
